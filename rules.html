  <h1>Rules</h1>
  <p></p>
  <h2>Preparations</h2>
  <p></p>
  <p>Shuffle all of the cards into a face-down pile. This pile is called a "draw-pile". When a card tells player to draw a card(s), the cards are drawn from this pile.</p>
  <p>Each player starts the game with 5 life points and 3 cards in hand. The game is played in alternating turns and the starting player is decided with a coin flip.</p>
  <p></p>
  <h2>Main phase</h2>
  <p></p>
  <p>At the beginning of player's turn that player draws a card. After that, they may play one of their cards either face-up or face-down.</p>
  <p>Many times, a card has a "When this card is played..." clause. If this is a case, the effect described after clause happens as you play the card.</p>
  <p>If the card has numbers at the top left corner and the bottom right corner, that card is an "Agent" and is place on that player's side of the table.</p>
  <p>If the card is not an Agent card, it is put into a face-up "discard pile", after the cards effect has resolved.</p>
  <p>After the player has played a card or has chosen to not play a card, they move to "Engagement phase". </p>
  <p></p>
  <h2>Engagement phase</h2>
  <p></p>
  <p>At the beginning of the engagement phase player whose turn it is, chooses and any number of Agents they control to "attack".</p>
  <p>The cards chosen this way can be moved forward a bit, to make it clear which Agents have been chosen and are attacking.</p>
  <p>After Agents attacking have been chosen, the other player chooses any number of their Agents to "block" the attacking Agents.</p>
  <p>Each blocking Agent may block a single attacking Agent. Multiple Agents can be assigned to block the same attacking Agent.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>After blockers have been chosen by the defending player, the attacking player may flip any number of their Agent cards.</p>
  <p>If a card has a "When this card is flipped to this side..." clause, the effect described after clause happens.</p>
  <p>If many such cards are flipped simultaneously, the attacking player chooses the order in which the effects happen.</p>
  <p>If a card flipped is not an Agent card. It is placed into the discard pile.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>After the attacking player is done flipping their cards, the defending player may flip any of their cards the same way.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>After both players have had their chance of flipping cards the attacking Agents and the Agents blocking them fight.</p>
  <p>The number in the top left corner is Agent's "power" and the number in the bottom right is it's "toughness".</p>
  <p>When two Agents fight, determine if the power of one is equal or greater than the toughness of another. If this is true, the Agent "perishes" and is placed into the discard pile.</p>
  <p>For example if two 1/2's fight each other, neither of them perishes. If a 2/2 and 1/2 fight, the 1/2 perishes while the 2/2 survives the fight.</p>
  <p>If multiple Agents are fighting a single target, treat those Agents as one Agent during that fight.</p>
  <p>The power of combined Agent is equal to sum of each of those Agent's power. Toughness is summed the same way. If the combined Agent would perish, all Agents making up that Agent perishes.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>After all fights have been resolved, all attacking Agents that were not blocked, "infiltrate". If an Agent has a "When this Agent infiltrates..." clause, the effect described after clause happens.</p>
